### Jan 28 / Feb 2
- Setup core Django project and core app
- Set up the foundation for modular URL routing, project URLS transfer to app URLS, and app URLS then route '' to homepage (default view)
- Created a base template via bootstrap and navbar for the consistent layout (will be updated further down the line)
- Created base homempage template (home.html) that extends the base, with a welcome message as a placeholder
- Tested: Hompage loads correctly with the welcome message, going to continue using bootstrap to benefit from the consistent styling.
